<h1> Ezra Arbuthnots Daily Blog. </h1>


<p1> Hello, welcome to my life blog.  I am Ezra Arbuthnot.  I am 12 years old, and I am a Kiwi in New Zealand. 
 I am doing unschooling, which is basically homeschooling, but the child decides the subjects based on their skill/ passion.
    For Me,  I do programming/computer or development, music, art, game development, filmmaking, and animation. I really like those subjects.
</p1>
<h2> What equipment do I use?</h2>

<p2> For my music, I use a launchkey mini MIDI keyboard, and I walso have a Scarlett Solo pack, which
includes a scarlett solo 4th gen headphones,  scarlett Solo sound interface, and scarlett microphone.  For my DAW, I use Logic Pro 10,8.  For my computer, I use a custom Apple Mac Mini, 
which works very well with all of my hobbies.  For programming, I use PyCharm, and VSC ( Visual Studio Code).  For the Video Game Design 
( which I have not fully started yet) I use Unreal Engine 5 to do all of my main development. </p2>

<h3> Hobbies and after school/ weekends:</h3>
<p3> During the weeekends, or holidays, I LOVE to play video games.  I play Roblox, TABS, X-plane 11, Crab Game, and War Thunder
    if you want to contact me on Discord, my username is EziBoi, and on Roblox, I have two accounts, SmileyCopFilmsYT (Main one) and a seperate
    account, SmileyCopFims, my first account I used.

<p4>  Blog Post 1: Welcome!!!
      15 April, 2024.

      Today, I have been working on prorgamming today.  I actually have been programming the blog website.  I have also bee working on my music. If 
      you want to see the music I have posted, go to soundcloud.com/ezra-arbuthnot. 
      Anyway, today has been good.  I am going to be working on artwork with my mom today.  I am doing the Cambrilearn Art Curriculum, which is a South African based
      that is based on Cambridge.  If you are wondering, my parents are actually from South Africa, though I was born in New Zealand, which explains why I don't have a NewZeland - kiwi accent, L.O.L
